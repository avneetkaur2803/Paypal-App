#  PayPal Demo App

This project is a simulation of a simple PayPal-style web application. It allows users to perform mock transactions, view updated balances, and experience a minimal yet functional financial interface â€” all built using front-end web technologies.

##  Project Objective

To create a static front-end application that mimics key features of the PayPal user interface such as:

- Sending money
- Updating balances in real-time
- Validating transactions (like insufficient balance or invalid input)

This is **purely educational** and does not connect to any real-world payment gateway.
